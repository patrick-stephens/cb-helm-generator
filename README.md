## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm repo add  
$ helm repo update
$ helm install  / -n 
```

## Introduction

This chart deploys  on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites


## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name ``:

```console
$ helm install  / -n 
```

The command deploys  on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the ``:

```console
$ helm delete  -n 
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the `` chart and their default values.

During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscaler associated with the cluster becomes inactive. Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading, setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from the HorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.   Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration A value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance but immediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed. When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `null`                       |

You can only expand a PVC if its storage class's "allowVolumeExpansion" field is set to true. Additionally, Kubernetes feature "ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes" must be enabled in order to expand the volumes which are actively bound to Pods. Volumes can only be expanded and not reduced to a smaller size. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#resizing-an- in-use-persistentvolumeclaim   If "EnableOnlineVolumeExpansion" is enabled for use within an evironment that does not actually support online volume and file system expansion then the cluster will fallback to rolling upgrade procedure to create a new set of Pods for use with resized Volumes.
